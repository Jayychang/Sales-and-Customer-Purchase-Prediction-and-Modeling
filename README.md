This project focused on building predictive models to support business decision-making around sales forecasting and customer purchase behavior. Using combined transactional datasets, I first cleaned and visualized sales and profit trends, identifying seasonality and structural patterns. To forecast total and category-level sales and profits for Q4 2024, I implemented and compared regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest), evaluating them with error metrics and visual diagnostics. In parallel, I developed classification models to predict whether customers would make a purchase when visiting the website, applying techniques such as logistic regression and decision trees, and rigorously validating performance with metrics like accuracy and recall. Together, these models demonstrate how advanced regression and classification approaches can provide actionable, data-driven insights for both financial planning and customer conversion strategies
